### Hello, my name is Dagnija Viktorova ðŸ˜Š

I'm a budding programmer who's most close with PHP, but is also familiar with HTML and CSS. I've been programming on and off for 5 years, but seriously took it up this year (2021).
I'm willing to learn more about technologies and become a better programmer. My goal is to become renown web developer, find a job in IT industry and keep working with computers.
